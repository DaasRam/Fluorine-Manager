# Fluorine Manager

Fluorine Manager an attempt at porting [MO2 (Mod Organizer 2)](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer) to linux with FUSE as the VFS system. A video guide for a quick setup can be found [here](https://youtu.be/yIZFUweb7v8). 

[NEXUS RELEASE](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1997)

NOTE: This is primarily for my personal use but I will see about fixing issues if I can. I use Claude/Codex, if you don't like AI please don't use this application. I'm looking for feedback not hate.

## Current Status

- Core app builds and runs on Linux.
- NaK integration is wired for game/proton detection and dependency handling.
- Linux-native game plugins (`libgame_*.so`) are supported.
- Portable instances are supported via local `ModOrganizer.ini` detection.

## Running Tools Without Steam

In **Edit Executables**, uncheck **Use Steam** for tools such as xEdit that do
not require Steam. This disables Fluorine's Steam startup prompt and automatic
Steam startup for that executable, including Proton's Steam integration.
The option defaults to enabled for existing and new executables; the instance's
Steam DRM setting still applies.

## Virtual Filesystem Backends

FUSE remains the default. Each instance can optionally use the experimental
USVFS backend for Wine/Proton executables from **Settings > Compatibility > VFS**.
Native Linux launches still use FUSE, and games such as OpenMW that provide
their own VFS are unchanged.

## Installing and Running
Download the latest zip from the [releases](https://github.com/SulfurNitride/Fluorine-Manager/releases) and after you download it.

You are able to run it with this command: `./fluorine-manager` or by double-clicking it.

Before running Windows games or tools, open **Settings > Compatibility**, select
a Proton version, and click **Set up now**. This creates the Wine prefix
and installs the required Windows components.

More information can be found in the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md).

You can find me in the [NaK Discord](https://discord.gg/9JWQzSeUWt)

If you want to support the things I put out, I do have a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/sulfurnitride) I will never charge money for any of my content.

## Building

Fluorine Manager is built inside a Docker/Podman container — no host toolchain setup required.

**Prerequisites:** Docker or Podman

```bash
./build.sh              # Build portable .tar.gz
```

The default output is `build/fluorine-manager.tar.gz` — extract anywhere and run `./fluorine-manager`.

### Runtime Requirements (Mainly NixOS)

- Windows games and tools need a configured Wine/Proton runtime. Steam is
  needed for Steam-dependent launches; GOG and other non-Steam games do not
  require Steam ownership.
- The following libraries are **not bundled** and must be available on your system:
  - `libEGL`
  - `libGL`
  - `libGLX`
  - `libstdc++`
  - NSS and NSPR (`libnss3` and `libnspr4` on Ubuntu)
  - `libX11`
  - `libxkbcommon`
  - `libfontconfig` with the host's Fontconfig configuration
  - `wayland` (if using wayland)

On most distros these are already present or installable via your package manager.

**NixOS:** Use `nix-ld` to expose the unbundled libraries. Add them to `programs.nix-ld.libraries` in your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
programs.nix-ld.enable = true;
programs.nix-ld.libraries = with pkgs; [
  libGL
  libGLX
  xorg.libX11
  libxkbcommon
  fontconfig
  stdenv.cc.cc.lib  # libstdc++
  nss
  nspr
];
```


## Known Limitations

- Some third-party MO2 plugins are Windows-only and will fail on Linux (for example DLL/ctypes `windll` assumptions).
